## 2026-05-03 — Paid Video Lectures On `events_tp`

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: paid video lectures and protected access.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-paid-video-lectures`.
- User request:
  - convert `https://moonn.ru/events_tp` from a registration/event page into a paid lecture storefront;
  - use price `1300 RUB` per lecture;
  - connect Tilda payment and protected video viewing;
  - use QR code and direct page link for promotion;
  - user approved one test scenario.
- Decisions:
  - Treat `events_tp` as the canonical pilot storefront, not `lectures1`.
  - Use Tilda products/cart plus Members/Courses access after payment.
  - Do not expose raw YouTube links on the public sales page.
  - Do not create or change live T-Bank/Tinkoff payment settings until seller/payment details are visually verified.
  - Use manifest-first rollout so product SKUs, Members groups, videos and QR links stay synchronized.
- Created or changed files:
  - `scripts/tilda_paid_lecture_audit.py`
  - `scripts/build_events_tp_paid_manifest.py`
  - `registry/products/paid-video-lectures-audit-2026-05-03.json`
  - `registry/products/paid-video-lectures.schema.json`
  - `registry/products/paid-video-lectures.manifest.json`
  - `assets/qr/tatyana-munn-paid-lectures-events-tp-qr.png`
  - `docs/paid-video-lectures-tilda-plan-2026-05-03.md`
- Verified:
  - Read-only Tilda API audit completed.
  - `events_tp` Tilda page id is `66814657`.
  - 10 unique Timepad event IDs were extracted from `events_tp`.
  - JSON files are syntactically valid.
  - QR image was generated for `https://moonn.ru/events_tp`.
- Open questions / blockers:
  - Video URL is still needed for each lecture.
  - User clarified that YouTube recordings are private/hidden, so public channel scan is insufficient.
  - YouTube Studio access or an exported owner video list is needed to match videos to lectures.
  - Confirm whether Timepad event `3334362` is a sellable recording or only a series/archive entry.
  - Tilda payment provider must be checked visually; read-only API did not expose active payment details.
  - Before production, run one staging or safe live test purchase and verify post-payment access.
- Risk notes:
  - Money/payment settings, seller requisites and paid content access are high-risk.
  - YouTube unlisted links are not real copy protection; use protected Tilda access as the minimum safe layer.
